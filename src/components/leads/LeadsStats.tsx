I don't have access to the original content of `src/components/leads/LeadsStats.tsx` in the code you shared. Without seeing the original file, I cannot reconstruct the complete code by replacing the `// ... keep existing code` comments with the actual code that was there before.

To help you with this task, please share the current content of `src/components/leads/LeadsStats.tsx` and I'll help you integrate the button changes while preserving all the existing functionality.
